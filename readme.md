## ParkWise

ParkWise is a parking management system developed in Python. It automates the process of managing parking spaces, reducing the workload on the management team and providing real-time updates to administrators and users. The system is designed to improve the overall parking experience by reducing the time taken for parking.

  -Polymorphism-parking_rate in base class is override as required
  
  -Encapsulation-Classes such as Vehicle,ParkingLot are used for data encapsulation
  
  -Abstraction-vehicle management and parking operations are abstracted within class and user calls
